The tester.py script, originally used to validate all functions inside the Agent_Brain, has been moved to its immediate parent directory within the Agent_Brain to improve clarity and organization.

How to run the tester again:
Open the Agent_Brain directory in your terminal.
Move the current tester.py file into this directory and optionally move test_log.txt file as well.
Now open a terminal in the root directory.

Run the following command:
python "Agent_Brain/tester.py"


All test results will be written to test_log.txt in the same directory.

Current Test Status:
After completing the branch setup, the test confirmed that all components executed correctly with no errors.
The time taken by each module have been studied and optimised as well over multiple iterations.
