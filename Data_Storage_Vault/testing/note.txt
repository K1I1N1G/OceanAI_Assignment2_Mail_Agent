The tester.py script, originally used to validate all functions inside the Data_Storage_Vault, has been moved to its immediate parent directory within the Data_Storage_Vault to improve clarity and organization.

How to run the tester again:
Open the Data_Storage_Vault directory in your terminal.
Move the current tester.py file into this directory and optionally move test_log.txt file as well.
Now open a terminal in the root directory.

Run the following command:
python "Data_Storage_Vault/tester.py"


All test results will be written to test_log.txt in the same directory.

Current Test Status:
After completing the branch setup, the test confirmed that all components executed correctly with no errors.
